# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a telecom customer will churn based on:
- Monthly Charges
- Tenure (in months)
- Number of Support Calls
- Contract Type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn

2. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py

## Files Used

- app.py â†’ Streamlit application
- model.pkl â†’ Trained Random Forest model
- WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv â†’ Original dataset
- plots/ â†’ Visualizations used for analysis

## Visualizations

### 1. Churn Distribution  
![Churn Distribution](plots/churn_distribution.png)

Shows the number of customers who churned vs. those who stayed. Useful to understand class imbalance.

---

### 2. Churn by Gender  
![Churn by Gender](plots/churn_gender.png)

Compares churn rates across male and female customers to detect any gender-based trends.

---

### 3. Feature Correlation Heatmap  
![Heatmap](plots/heatmap.png)

Shows correlation between numerical features like tenure, monthly charges, etc.

---

### 4. Payment Method Pie Chart  
![Pie Chart](plots/pie.png)

Displays the proportion of different payment methods used by customers.

---

### 5. ROC Curve  
![ROC Curve](plots/roc.png)

Visualizes model performance. AUC score shows how well churn is predicted.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **churn prediction pipeline** using a Random Forest Classifier.  
The Streamlit app allows users to input customer details and get real-time predictions, while the visualizations provide insight into churn behavior.  
It can help telecom providers identify and retain customers who are likely to churn.
